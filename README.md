<h2>About My Portfolio</h2>

This portfolio showcases my journey as a Full-Stack Developer, highlighting the projects, skills, and technologies I have worked with. It includes real-world applications, mini projects, and experiments that demonstrate my understanding of frontend and backend development.

The goal of this portfolio is to present my technical abilities, problem-solving approach, and continuous learning mindset. Each project reflects my focus on writing clean code, building user-friendly interfaces, and creating practical solutions.

I will keep updating this portfolio as I learn new technologies and build more impactful projects.
